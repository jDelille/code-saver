## Shmagity

Shmagity is a website where users can save lines of code. Reusing code is something I do a lot and keeping track of them was never easy. With Shmagity you can easily save and find code in seconds. The backend is deployed using Heroku and the frontend is deployed using Netlify. This makes it easy to include updates in the future to make this website even better!
